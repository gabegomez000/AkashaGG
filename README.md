# AkashaGG
A simple Genshin Impact web app written in Python using Streamlit.

The AkashaGG web app provides users with the ability to search for basic character information, artifact stats, and other miscellaneous information for the video game Genshin Impact. The web app currently does not provide weapon information or advanced character information, with plans to support these in future updates.

The web app uses information provided by theBowja's genshin-db API, available here: https://github.com/theBowja/genshin-db
