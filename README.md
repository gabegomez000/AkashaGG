# AkashaGG
A web application developed using Python with the Streamlit framework.

The AkashaGG web app provides users with the ability to search for basic character information, artifact stats, and other miscellaneous information for the video game Genshin Impact. The web app currently does not provide weapon information or advanced character information, with plans to support these in future updates.

It uses information provided by theBowja's genshin-db API, available here: https://github.com/theBowja/genshin-db
